# README

Tiler is a small web application that allows you to scribble your thoughts in a few organized colourful panels. Based on http://5iler.me.

DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for any loss of information/data when using this application. Do not use any code structure, paradigms or algorithms as good written code. This project was hacked together in the span of a couple of days, and as such do not make use of any good coding or development conventions.

## Bugs

 - [FF] When the text area is empty, the cursor jumps up
 - [FF] Text area height is really screwed up
 - [CR] The text area doesn't scale

## Todo

 - Fix handlers all over the place (jQuery, Knockout, Mousetrap)
 - Fix HTML/CSS text area

 - Delete panels
 - Split panels vertically
